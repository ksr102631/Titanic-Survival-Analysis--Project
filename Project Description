When the Titanic sank, 1502 of the 2224 passengers and crew were killed. One of the main reasons for this
high level of casualties was the lack of lifeboats on this self-proclaimed "unsinkable" ship.

Those that have seen the movie know that some individuals were more likely to survive the sinking (lucky Rose)
than others (poor Jack). 

Here we will apply machine learning techniques to predict a passenger's chance of surviving using Python.
